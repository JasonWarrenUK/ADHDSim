## CSS 

### CSS Structure

Had a feeling my CSS was becoming unwieldy, so looked up some general structure advice. Followed the advice in [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Organizing)

### is()

Discovered the ```is()``` selector, which will make things a lot neater

### Flexbox Woes

Today is the day. We're wrestling this bastard concept into submission. It will do what I want.

* Header is now a flexbox container, allowing me to have the site title situated top left along with a page-level subtitle/strapline to the top right

## HTML

### HTML Structure

Decided that, for now, I should just fully lean into a totally card-based layout. Trying to have all of the following:

* some things in cards
* some things outside of cards
* flexbox layout at the highest level

was causing major fudging... a super-specific solution here, a spaghetti addition there... I suspect it's better to have clean code across the board right now rather than nail how one title looks on one page.
