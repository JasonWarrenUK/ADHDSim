## Creating a Web of Linked Nodes

Prompt
> Using only JavaScript, HTML and CSS, how can I display all the pages on my website as a web of linked nodes? I also cannot use any external libraries.

Answer
> Sure, here is how you can display all the pages on your website as a web of linked nodes using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS:

1. Create a HTML page with an empty <div> element.
2. Use JavaScript to get the list of all the pages on your website. You can do this by using the document.links property.
3. For each page in the list, create a new <li> element and add it to the <div> element.
4. Set the href attribute of the <li> element to the URL of the page.
5. Set the text content of the <li> element to the title of the page.
6. Use CSS to style the <li> elements as nodes in a web.
  
> Here is an example of the JavaScript code you can use to get the list of all the pages on your website:

``` javascript
var pages = document.links;
```

> Here is an example of the CSS code you can use to style the <li> elements as nodes in a web:

``` css
  li {
      margin: 0 10px;
      padding: 5px;
      border: 1px solid black;
      cursor: pointer;
  }
  li:hover {
      background-color: lightgray;
  }
```

> Once you have created the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, you can load the page in your browser and you will see a web of linked nodes representing all the pages on your website.
> Here is an example of what the web of linked nodes might look like:

* index.html
* about.html
* contact.html
* products.html
* services.html

> The index.html page would be the root node of the web, and the other pages would be linked to it. You could click on any of the pages to load it in your browser.
> I hope this helps!

## Neurotype Switcher

Prompt
> Using only JavaScript, HTML & CSS without any external libraries, is it possible to create a switch that, when toggled by the user, will change which stylesheet the page is linked to?

Answer

> Yes, it is possible to create a switch that, when toggled by the user, will change which stylesheet the page is linked to. Here is an example of how to do this:

```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>

  <head>
  <title>Switching Stylesheets</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="light.css" />
  <script>
  function changeStylesheet() {
    var link = document.getElementById("stylesheet");
    var href = link.getAttribute("href");
    if (href == "light.css") {
      link.setAttribute("href", "dark.css");
    } else {
      link.setAttribute("href", "light.css");
    }
  }
  </script>
  </head>

  <body>
  <h1>Switching Stylesheets</h1>
  <button onclick="changeStylesheet()">Toggle Stylesheet</button>
  <link id="stylesheet" rel="stylesheet" href="light.css" />
  </body>

  </html>
```

> In this example, we have two stylesheets, `light.css` and `dark.css`. We have a button that, when clicked, calls the `changeStylesheet()` function. This function gets the `link` element with the id `stylesheet` and gets the href attribute of the element. If the href attribute is equal to `light.css`, then the function sets the href attribute to `dark.css`. Otherwise, the function sets the href attribute to `light.css`.
> When the user clicks the button, the `changeStylesheet()` function will be called and the href attribute of the `link` element will be changed. This will cause the browser to load the new stylesheet and the page will be updated with the new styles.
> This is just a simple example, but it shows how you can use JavaScript to switch between stylesheets. You can use this technique to create a switch that allows the user to choose between different themes for your website.
