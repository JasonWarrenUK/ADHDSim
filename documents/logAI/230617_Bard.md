## Saturday 24th June: Creating a Web of Linked Nodes

* Prompt
  * Using only JavaScript, HTML and CSS, how can I display all the pages on my website as a web of linked nodes? I also cannot use any external libraries.
* Answer
  * Sure, here is how you can display all the pages on your website as a web of linked nodes using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS:
    1. Create a HTML page with an empty ```<div>``` element.
    2. Use JavaScript to get the list of all the pages on your website. You can do this by using the document.links property.
    3. For each page in the list, create a new ```<li>``` element and add it to the ```<div>``` element.
    4. Set the href attribute of the ```<li>``` element to the URL of the page.
    5. Set the text content of the ```<li>``` element to the title of the page.
    6. Use CSS to style the ```<li>``` elements as nodes in a web.
  * Here is an example of the JavaScript code you can use to get the list of all the pages on your website:
    var pages = document.links;
  * Here is an example of the CSS code you can use to style the ```<li>``` elements as nodes in a web:
    li {
        margin: 0 10px;
        padding: 5px;
        border: 1px solid black;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
    li:hover {
        background-color: lightgray;
    }
  * Once you have created the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, you can load the page in your browser and you will see a web of linked nodes representing all the pages on your website.
  * Here is an example of what the web of linked nodes might look like:
    * index.html
    * about.html
    * contact.html
    * products.html
    * services.html
  * The index.html page would be the root node of the web, and the other pages would be linked to it. You could click on any of the pages to load it in your browser.
  * I hope this helps!

## Saturday 17th June: Allowing User Annotations

* Prompt
  * I am building a website using only standard HTML, CSS & JavaScript. How can I implement a functionality that allows the user to annotate the website and have those annotations displayed?
* Answer
  * To implement a functionality that allows the user to annotate the website and have those annotations displayed, you can use the following steps:
    * Create a HTML element to store the annotations. This element can be a div or a textarea element.
    * Add an event listener to the element to detect when the user clicks on it. When the user clicks on the element, you can use the event listener to open a modal dialog where the user can enter their annotation.
    * When the user clicks on the "Save" button in the modal dialog, you can add the annotation to the element. You can then use CSS to style the annotation to make it stand out from the rest of the text on the page.
  * Here is an example of how to implement this functionality:

    ``` html
    <div id="annotations"></div>
    ```

    ``` javascript
    var annotations = document.getElementById("annotations");

    annotations.addEventListener("click", function() {
    var modal = document.createElement("div");
    modal.innerHTML = "<h2>Add Annotation</h2><textarea></textarea>";

    var saveButton = document.createElement("button");
    saveButton.innerHTML = "Save";
    saveButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
        var annotation = modal.querySelector("textarea").value;
        annotations.appendChild(document.createTextNode(annotation));
        modal.style.display = "none";
    });

    modal.appendChild(saveButton);
    document.body.appendChild(modal);

    modal.style.display = "block";
    });
    ```

  * This code will create a div element with the id "annotations". When the user clicks on this element, a modal dialog will appear. The user can then enter their annotation in the textarea element in the modal dialog. When the user clicks on the "Save" button, the annotation will be added to the "annotations" element. The modal dialog will then be hidden.
  * You can use CSS to style the annotations to make them stand out from the rest of the text on the page. For example, you could use a different color for the annotations, or you could make them bold.
