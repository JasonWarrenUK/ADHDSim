### Projects
#### Project 1: Rupert's Pigpen
Just me trying to build a basic web page to display capacity to learn different web languages

I followed the w3schools HTML tutorial, building this page as I went.

To make it a creative project rather than just a process of imitation, I decided to explore how to create humour & personality through code. Therefore, this has been made as the personal website of a small piglet who has just discovered a computer & has no idea what he's doing.

Examples include:
- How to make a really ugly colour palette that still actually adheres to colour theory & design principles
- How to use the code itself to explore humour (e.g. through commenting)
- Using over-the-top methods to present & explore nonsense ideas (e.g. tables & lists backing up the pig's assertion that we can empirically rate & rank crunchy snacks)
- Using highlighted text & mouse-over messages to insert silly "notes to self"
