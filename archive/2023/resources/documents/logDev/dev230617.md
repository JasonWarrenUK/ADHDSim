## Shoulda Coulda Woulda

Possibly, I should have established the format for my devblog earlier on, but lolADHD.

## CSS Gubbins

Anyway, I'm waiting for more ADHD meds (cheers doctor, always appreciate some enforced brainfog) but have the focus to do some coding things. Now that I've got some sense of direction about how to style my page, I've bitten the bullet and started trawling through the freeFrontEnd site that Reza showed me.

So now I've got a few codepen collections for different elements. Spent ages realising that I hadn't clocked that some things use external libraries (SCSS being the main bastard). But now I have stuff, and I'm making some test builds.

## Annotater Function

I have an idea about creating a way for the panel to annotate my website as they look at it. Kinda like embracing the realities of what this process is for and using that to create a function rather than just feel anxious about it.

I asked Bard how I might go about it.
