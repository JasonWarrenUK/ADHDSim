# The Endless Tangent

## Final Statement

### Website

Well, here it is. The website doesn't work how I wanted it to, but I have the core functionality at least prototyped.

The neuroswitcher function is bare bones at best; right now, it's simply a binary ADHD/no ADHD setting that I somehow broke at the last moment. Its intended function is that "ADHD On" removes any order or structure from the site, but also reveals content previously hidden. This is a basic attempt to model impulsivity (not biting my tongue) and difficulties with prioritisation (unordered content).

The site is not mobile friendly. At all. I had wanted to get there, but circumstances got in the way. I'm pleased with the desktop layout though! It's a set of flexboxes within flexboxes, with divs that can be dynamically hidden and displayed according to page or theme. It took a while to code by hand, but I think I learned a lot.

### Game

I'm devastated because I only realised today that the game also had to use only vanilla JavaScript. I had thought this was a requirement for the website only, and thus my work in ink (a C# derived language) isn't submittable. I tried to start rebuilding it at the last moment, and I'm impressed that I learned how to do Grid layout literally today (viewable on the game html site), but there was no way it was going to happen.

### A Plea for Compassionate Treatment/Reasonable Adjustment

I have not met the criteria you set. Specifically, my game is not playable.

For a number of personal reasons I didn't want to put on the website proper out of respect to my family, I have barely kept afloat during this process and have been supporting numerous crises. I would ask that you look at my work in that light. I ask that you look at my code, and look at the website I've linked to that I built for the previous round, and judge my progress. As supplementary evidence, there are games linked to on my website, just not built in JavaScript.

In addition, whilst I have enjoyed every second of the learning process, these criteria are so much harder for some neurodivergent people than the 5 projects for the previous round. The freedom is exciting, but it is so hard to know how far we're meant to go. Again, I ask that you look at my work in that light.

If you deem that there is not sufficient evidence of my capacity to learn, I absolutely respect that decision. But, at the risk of embarassing myself, I am begging you; please take my circumstances into account. This application process is so much harder for me than a curriculum of structured learning.

The one decision I implore you not to take is to say I have promise but you'd like me to attempt another round of application. In my free time, I am drowning under the combined pulls of my partner's health, a desperate scrabble to earn enough money to survive in a contracting industry and the demands of managing my ADHD. I had saved enough money to allow me to spend some time on this application, and another bit to get me through the first three months of the course.

I won't be able to apply again, and I am desperately afraid of constantly being in this loop - constantly being barred from spaces I could thrive in because the application process, which most people find less demanding, is structured for other people.

I have never, in my whole life, written a message like this. I have never asked for reasonable adjustments, special treatment or protection. I am petrified that it will render me entitled or unsuitable in your eyes. Joining this course means that much to me.
